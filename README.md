# low-level-gamedev-env
## Description
The idea is to develop a dedicated environment to start developing games.
Feel free to contribute to the project, fix issues, or develop it further.

## Objective and why
I've been using UE5 for a while, and it got me frustrated with how resource-demanding and slow the engine is. 
Thus development flow gets abruted by continuous compiling time. I wanna build something lightweight and C++-oriented

Hopefully, i won't abandon this project midway through, if I do you can go ahead and contribute to it.
